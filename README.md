# SAGAR — SAR-based Automated Geospatial Analysis for Recognition of oil spills

A frontend-only prototype of a marine oil spill detection and AIS vessel
attribution intelligence platform, built for the **NTRO Disaster Management**
hackathon track.

This app visualizes: satellite-detected oil slicks, spill geometry and
estimated area, drift hindcast/forecast, AIS vessel tracks, a ranked suspect
vessel list with an attribution scoring breakdown, behavior anomaly
timelines, and a one-click PDF evidence dossier — all driven by realistic
**mock data**, ready to be wired to a real backend later.

> This repo contains **frontend only**. No ML, no satellite processing, no
> AIS ingestion, no FastAPI service — those are out of scope by design. See
> "Connecting the real backend" below.

## 1. Technology stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | React 18 + TypeScript |
| Build tool | Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Map | Leaflet + react-leaflet (dark CARTO basemap, optional Mapbox) |
| Animation | Framer Motion |
| Icons | lucide-react |
| PDF export | jsPDF |
| HTTP | Axios (wired for a future FastAPI backend) |

---

## 2. Installation

```bash
cd project-main
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:5173`.

```bash
npm run build     # type-check + production build to dist/
npm run preview   # preview the production build locally
```

---

## 3. Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and adjust as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

| Variable | Purpose | Default behavior if unset |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN` | Enables the Mapbox `dark-v11` tile style | Falls back to a free CARTO dark basemap — the app never crashes without a token |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Base URL of the future FastAPI backend | `http://localhost:8000/api` |
| `VITE_USE_MOCK` | `true` (default) uses local mock data; `false` calls the real backend | `true` |

---

## 4. Map API

The main map is implemented in `src/components/MapView.tsx`.

- With `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN`, the app loads Mapbox Dark v11 tiles.
- Without a token, it automatically falls back to CARTO's dark basemap.
- The application map layers (oil spill, drift, forecast, satellite footprint and AIS tracks) are rendered with Leaflet.
- See `MAP_API_SETUP.md` for the exact setup steps.

## 5. Mock API architecture

Every screen reads data through the functions in `src/api/client.ts`:

```ts
getSpillData()
getVessels()
getVesselTrack(vesselId)
getSatelliteData()
getOceanographicData()
getInvestigation()
getSystemStatus()
```

No component ever imports mock data directly — they only call these
functions and get back typed `Promise`s. Internally, each function checks
`VITE_USE_MOCK`:

- **`true` (default):** returns realistic mock data (with an artificial
  network delay) so the UI feels alive during development.
- **`false`:** calls the real endpoint via the shared `axios` instance
  (`apiClient`), pointed at `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

This means the FastAPI backend can be dropped in later with **zero changes**
to any React component.

---

## 6. Connecting the real FastAPI backend later

1. Stand up FastAPI endpoints that match the shapes in `src/types/index.ts`
   (they're written to map cleanly onto Pydantic models):
   `GET /spill`, `GET /vessels`, `GET /vessels/{id}/track`,
   `GET /satellite`, `GET /ocean`, `GET /investigation`, `GET /system-status`.
2. Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the backend's base URL.
3. Set `VITE_USE_MOCK=false`.
4. Restart the dev server. That's it — no component code changes.

---

## 7. Replacing mock data

All mock data lives inside `src/api/client.ts` in a handful of `getMock*()`
functions and two small lookup tables (`MOCK_TRACK_OFFSETS`). To adjust the
demo scenario (different spill location, more vessels, different attribution
scores), edit those functions directly — the rest of the app reads whatever
shape they return, so nothing else needs to change as long as the
TypeScript types in `src/types/index.ts` are respected.

---

## 8. Generating the evidence dossier

Click **"Generate Evidence Dossier"** at the bottom of the right-hand
Intelligence Panel. This calls `generateEvidenceDossier()` in
`src/utils/pdfGenerator.ts`, which builds a multi-section PDF entirely from
in-memory state (spill info, satellite observation, geometry & origin,
hindcast/forecast, suspect ranking, attribution breakdown, AIS correlation,
and behavior anomaly timelines) and triggers a browser download. No network
call or backend is involved — it works purely off whatever is currently
loaded in the app.

---

## 9. Notes

- All vessel names, IMO numbers, and attribution scores are **fictional**
  and generated for demonstration purposes only.
- The app is designed to degrade gracefully: missing Mapbox token, empty
  data, or a failed fetch all produce readable in-UI messaging rather than
  a crash.
- Built desktop-first for 1440×900, responsive down through laptop/tablet;
  side panels collapse progressively as the viewport narrows.
